# Handling Errors

When a user inputs the wrong value into the main terminal, it will display and error message and place them back at the main menu. This will work with any given value outside of 1-4.

# Interesting piece of code

Two pieces within my main method to note:
1. The boolean value is set to false by default until a value is inputted that corresponds to one of the calculators (1-3) or to terminate the application (4).
2. I implemented a method to catch a value that is not 1-4, it will display an error message and redirect the user to the main menu.
